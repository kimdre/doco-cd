## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

> [!WARNING]
> **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:
- create a [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/kimdre/doco-cd/security/advisories/new)
- send an email to opensource[@]drechsel.xyz.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- The version and/or location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
